- Format Validation Tools: Validators or tools like xmllint (for XML), jq (for JSON), and yamllint (for YAML).
- Version Control: Use Git to manage versions of your OSCAL documents.
- Programming Languages: Programming languages such as Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, or other languages with libraries to manipulate these formats, if you need to develop custom tools or integrations.
